# BTP610: Mobile Applications
I have learn to create React Native applications and most of the time worked on IOS. It was fun and exciting journey which I am devoting myself to for the future as well.

**What I have accomplished during this semester**: a static Youtube Shorts clone, a Receipt calculator, one screen POIS app and finally the most complicated one the Car Rental App.

**Here is what I have learned:**
 - Differences between native and cross platform mobile development.
  - Architecture and lifecycle of a mobile application 
  - Implementing the graphical user interface for a single screen of a mobile application.
  - Applying navigation and data passing to a multi screen application.
  - Evaluating and integrating a data persistence layer into a mobile application.
   - Utilizing web services to enrich a mobile application. 
   - Developing features that interact with mobile device hardware. 
   - Techniques for deploying and testing a mobile app.
