# BTP610: Mobile Applications

I have learn to create React Native applications and most of the time worked on IOS. It was fun and exciting journey which I am devoting myself to for the future as well.

  

**What I have accomplished during this semester**: a static Youtube Shorts clone, a Receipt calculator, one screen POIS app and finally the most complicated one the Car Rental App.

  

**Here is what I have learned:**

- Differences between native and cross platform mobile development.

- Architecture and lifecycle of a mobile application

- Implementing the graphical user interface for a single screen of a mobile application.

- Applying navigation and data passing to a multi screen application.

- Evaluating and integrating a data persistence layer into a mobile application.

- Utilizing web services to enrich a mobile application.

- Developing features that interact with mobile device hardware.

- Techniques for deploying and testing a mobile app.
